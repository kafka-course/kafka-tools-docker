# kafka-tools-docker
## What this is about

This is about to provide a docker-image to assist the developer working eg. with a kafka-cluster running in docker-compose by providing tools like:

* kafkacut
* kafka command line tools like
  * kafka-console-producer.sh ...
* python kafka-tools

With the help of them, the developer can inspect the kafka-setup, send and receive messages and more to debug problems...
